# Contributing

This list is currently in its baby shoes. Contributions are more than welcome!
Please open a pull request or issue to suggest additions or changes. These
changes can fit into one of the existing categories, but feel free to suggest a
new category if you think it would be appropriate.

## Guidelines for contributing

- There are currently no strict requirements for a project to be eligible for
  inclusion, other than:
  - It should be relevant to the topic of lazygit
  - It should prefferably be open source
    ([free/libre](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)).
- Add to the list in alphabetical order for easier navigation.
- Add to the list in the following format:

```md
- [Project Name](Project Link): Brief description of the project.
```

or

```md
- [Project Name](Project Link) with [integration guide](integration guide link):
  Brief description of the project.
```

- Prefferably, link to a project source in this order of preference:
  - GitHub Repository
  - Project Website
  - GitHub Gist
  - GitHub Discussion
- Follow the existing formatting for consistency.
  - You can use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and
    [Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) to help automate
    formatting for you.
  - Please wrap lines at 80 characters (unless it breaks a link).
- When adding a custom command (or project that integrates through a custom
  command):
  - Include a link to the custom command, rather than just the command `yaml`
    itself.
  - If you're adding a project that integrates through a custom command, please
    also include a link to the integration guide that shows the custom command
    `yaml`.
- When adding a new category:
  - Add it in alphabetical order.
  - Provide a brief description of the category at the top of the section.
  - Ensure that there is at least one relevant project to include in the new
    category.
  - Use a level 2 heading (`##`) for the category title.
  - Add it to the table of contents at the top of the README.md file.
